## Setup

Create a virtual enviroment and install the dependencies:

```
python -m venv ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have the dataset yet download it by running the command:

```
python download_dataset.py
```

Train the model by running the command:

```
python train.py
```
